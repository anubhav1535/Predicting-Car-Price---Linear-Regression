# Predicting Car Price - Linear Regression
I've employed a Linear Regression model to forecast the price of a car based on various factors. To ensure the reliability of the model, I meticulously cleaned the dataset, examined the distributions of variables, and generated dummy variables where necessary. Through thorough analysis, I explored the relationships between different features and the car price, identifying key predictors. This comprehensive approach not only enhances the accuracy of the predictive model but also provides valuable insights into the factors influencing car pricing.
